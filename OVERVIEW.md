# Overview

Before your next technical interview, we would like for you to complete the following programming assignment.

We will use this exercise to get a sense of your problem solving skills, your decomposition skills, and the way that you approach refactoring.

## Parameters

- Complete the requirement as described below
- Do not spend more than a 3-4 hours on it. (It doesn’t need to be perfect, be ingenious)
- Be prepared to speak about any extra work that you would’ve done if you had more time at an onsite.
- Your solution will be discussed during the interview.
- Use whatever language and framework you prefer. (We typically use React/Javascript/Typescript).

## Problem Description

Provide a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) implementation. At a minimum, this program should offer the following features:

- Enter a PIN to identify a unique customer
- Query and show the current account balance
- Simulate the withdrawal of cash
- Simulate a deposit
- A daily withdrawal limit

## Submit the following

- Provide complete steps to compile and run your project.
- The full source of your solution in a Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab repo.
  - During your technical interview, we will:
  - Ask you to describe your design and implementation decisions.
  - Ask you to talk about testing scenarios and considerations for real-world deployment.
  - Ask you about the next set of features that you would want to implement or any improvements on your current implementation.
- For ease of sharing we recommend using codesandbox.io, but it’s not required.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
